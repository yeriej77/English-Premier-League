<h1>MySQL - English Premier League Database</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
The task is to design a comprehensive database for the English Premier Soccer League (EPL), comprising 20 clubs primarily from England, open to qualifying Welsh clubs. The league is divided into two halves, with each team playing the other 19 twice, once at their home stadium and once at the opponents'. Victorious teams earn three points, draws award one point to each, while losers receive no points. At season end, the bottom two teams face direct relegation to the lower-tier Championship. The top two Championship teams replace these relegated teams in the following EPL season. Additionally, teams ranking third and fourth from the bottom contend in two matches (home and away) to determine the third team facing relegation. Similar matches occur between the third and fourth Championship teams to identify the third team moving up to the EPL the next season.

Each club can roster up to 25 players, with a requirement that eight must be homegrown (assumed to be English for simplicity). A game initiates with 11 players per team, allowing up to five substitutes and one concussion substitution. Once substituted, a player cannot re-enter the same game. Players risk yellow cards for fouls or rule violations; two yellow cards result in a red card, leading to ejection from the current game and missing the subsequent match. Direct red cards can also prompt immediate ejection.

Games involve several officials, including the head referee, two assistant referees, and a reserve referee. The database intends to record scorers, their team affiliation, goal minute, and the type of goal (including own goals). Additionally, a historical record of players and managers/assistant managers will be maintained.<br />
